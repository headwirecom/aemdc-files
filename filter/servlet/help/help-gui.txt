Create a Servlet Filter

"Felix" Filters are different from Sling Filters,
in that they are executed by Apache Felix before the Sling Engine is engaged.

This allows for:
- Processing a request before Sling Authentication and Resource Resolution has occurs.

This prevents:
- Understanding accessing any Sling Context; Permissions, Resource Resolution, etc.


Provide placeholders as needed. Default values will be used derived from the 'Target Name'.
