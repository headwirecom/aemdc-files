Create a Sling filter with INCLUDE scope

Include filters are called upon calling the RequestDispatcher.include method
after the included resource and the Servlet or script to process the include
have been resolved before the Servlet or script is called.

Provide placeholders as needed. Default values will be used derived from the 'Target Name'.
