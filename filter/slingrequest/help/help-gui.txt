Create a Sling filter with REQUEST scope

Request filters are called once per request hitting Sling from the outside.
These filters are called after the resource addressed by the request URL and the
Servlet or script to process the request has been resolved before the COMPONENT filters
(if any) and the Servlet or script are called.

Provide placeholders as needed. Default values will be used derived from the 'Target Name'.
